OneLife RP Server Rules
👋 Welcome to OneLife Roleplay! Please take a moment to read through our rules to ensure everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience.

🧠 Mental Health and Well-being
- Roleplay can be intense. Remember to take care of your mental health. If you feel overwhelmed, it's okay to take a break. Our community is here to support you, and we encourage open discussions about well-being.

🆕 New Player Orientation
- New to OneLife Roleplay? Welcome! We offer an orientation session or mentor system to help you get started. Feel free to reach out to the Staff Team for more information.

🔔 Important Information:

- 🚫 Please don’t DM any Admin or Owner on Discord unless they ask you to. If you need to contact them, create a support ticket instead.

- 🎮 Do NOT approach or call any Owner, Admin, or Developer in the city about ticket progress, development queries, or out-of-city information. They are there to roleplay (RP) and should be treated like any other player.

⚠️ Not following these rules will have consequences.

🕒 Server Restarts: 
- Log out safely before scheduled maintenance to avoid losing progress or items.

🌐 Conduct Outside the Server:
- How you behave in community spaces like Discord and social media reflects on our server. Be respectful and supportive of each other. Avoid toxic behavior, harassment, or spreading drama outside the game.

🔐 Your Account:
- 🔒 It’s your responsibility to keep your account details secure. OneLife Roleplay isn’t responsible for hacked accounts.
- ⚠️ FiveM/CFX name should always be same as your character name and discord name - timeout will be given for non compliance.

👶 IRL Player Age:
- 🎂 Our Roleplay community is for players aged 18 and above to maintain a mature environment for storytelling and character interactions.

🎙 Microphone/Audio:
- 🎧 Your microphone and audio must always work for seamless communication.
- 🎤 Use “Push-To-Talk” as the default setting to keep the atmosphere respectful.
- 🎤 Voice changers should be avoided, especially if disturbing other members.

OneLife RP Server Rules
🚸 Behavior
- 💼Server Staff Restrictions: Admins and staff from other servers need permission to join our server. Likewise, our admins and staff need approval to be on other servers. This prevents conflicts of interest and ensures dedication to our community.
- ❌ Harassment or attacks towards another player will result in a ban.
- 💢 We do NOT tolerate toxicity, including excessive foul language, racism, sexism, or inappropriate roleplay (e.g., using bodily fluids). This includes emotes and /me commands.

🚫 AFK Rules:
- Don’t stay AFK (Away From Keyboard) for more than 15 minutes. Log out if you need to step away longer, so others can join.
- Items lost due to being afk is your own  responsibility.
- Once taken hostage in a non safe zone stating being afk won't be valid.

🛑 Respect for Personal Boundaries:
- Roleplay is encouraged, but respect others’ boundaries. If someone is uncomfortable with a certain roleplay (e.g., violent scenarios), respect their wishes and adjust accordingly.
Handling Personal Conflicts: Handle personal conflicts through support tickets. Keep respect and don’t let personal issues affect roleplay.

🚷 Poaching:
- 👥 Poaching is not allowed. If you’re not actively participating in our city’s RP and are just recruiting players for another server, you’ll be banned.

🛡️ OneLife Roleplay Safe Zones:
Safe Zones are areas where all forms of criminal activity (e.g., hostage-taking, shooting, drug deals, stealing vehicles, robbing) are strictly prohibited. Doing anything illegal in these areas is a breach of server rules and will result in a warning or ban. Safe Zones can’t be used to hide or escape an RP scene.
